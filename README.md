# TwitterBot

This is my first time playing with twitter APIs.
Let's see how it goes.

# @BotRaghu

The twitter bot can now be deployed both at heroku as well as amazon ec2 node instance.I would link the demos but since both the deployments are worker nodes so the twitter handle will have to do [@BotRaghu](https://twitter.com/BotRaghu)


# Next?

Will now try to add different function to the bot in addition to the function listed in file names.
